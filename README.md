# 🏬 Warehouse Demand & Inventory Optimization

This repository provides tools for analyzing, visualizing, and predicting retail inventory demand using machine learning. It includes a Streamlit web app for demand forecasting and a Jupyter notebook for exploratory data analysis.

## Folder Contents

- **app.py**  
  Streamlit web application for inventory demand prediction and visualization.

- **ot_data_vis.ipynb**  
  Jupyter notebook for exploratory data analysis and visualization of retail inventory and sales data.

- **retail_inventory_dataset.csv**  
  Main dataset containing historical inventory and sales records.

- **retail_dataset_with_predictions.csv**  
  Dataset with model predictions (may be generated by the app or notebook).

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/warehouse-demand.git
cd warehouse-demand
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install Python packages (preferably in a virtual environment):

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Required packages include:**  
- streamlit  
- pandas  
- xgboost  
- joblib  
- matplotlib  
- seaborn

### 3. Prepare Model

Ensure you have the trained XGBoost model file (`xgb_demand_model.pkl`) in the project directory.  
If not, train the model using your data and save it using `joblib`.

### 4. Run the Streamlit App

```sh
streamlit run app.py
```

### 5. Explore the Notebook

Open `ot_data_vis.ipynb` in JupyterLab or VS Code to explore data visualizations and analysis.
